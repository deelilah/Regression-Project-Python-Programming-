The metric of success will be accomplished when i am able to give adequate result of the game between the two teams based on who is home and away.Furthermore show if the scores are for the friendly or real match. and the scores by each team.

c.) Understanding the context
The new model for calculating the FIFA/Coca-Cola World Ranking (FWR) was developed over two years during which time a large number of different algorithms was tested and extensively discussed. Throughout this review and consultation process, the main aim was to identify an algorithm that is not only intuitive, easy to understand and improves overall accuracy of the formula, but also addresses feedback received about the previous model and provides fair and equal opportunities for all teams across all confederations to ascend the FWR.

d.) Record the Experiment Design
Data Cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis

Perform your EDA

Perform any necessary feature engineering

Check of multicollinearity

Start building the model

Cross-validate the model

Compute RMSE

Create residual plots for your models, and assess their heteroscedasticity using Bartlettâ€™s test
